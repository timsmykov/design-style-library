# Unified DESIGN.md — Airbnb Marketplace Warm Consumer

This file is the single-pack runtime view for `airbnb-marketplace-warm-consumer`.

Authority inside this file:

1. VoltAgent DESIGN.md baseline gives broad visual grammar.
2. Hermes deep extension overrides baseline with local evidence, tokens, components, eval, and implementation guardrails.
3. Use local paths only; do not call GitHub/Mobbin/web/browser at runtime.

description: A warm, generous consumer marketplace anchored on a clean white canvas and Airbnb Rausch (#ff385c), the single brand voltage that carries every primary CTA, search-button orb, and rating dot. Type runs Airbnb Cereal VF at modest weights — display sits at 22–28px in weight 500/600 rather than the heavy 700+ that fintech and enterprise systems use; the brand trusts photography and generous whitespace over typographic muscle. Three product entries (Homes, Experiences, Services) sit in the top nav with hand-illustrated 32-icon glyphs and "NEW" badges, signaling a marketplace expansion rather than a feature dump. Pill-shaped search bars (`{rounded.full}`), softly rounded property cards (`{rounded.lg}` ~14px), and 32px button radii read as friendly and human — there is no hard corner anywhere except the body grid.

# Hermes deep extension override

## STYLE.md excerpt

# Airbnb Marketplace Warm Consumer

Status: runtime-ready extension inside the unified Hermes design pack.

## Style formula

warm consumer marketplace; photo-first listing cards; search/filter/map rhythm; hospitality trust, reviews and booking clarity; soft neutral canvas with confident coral action

This pack is meant for generation, review, and critique. It should give an agent enough local information to design a screen without opening Mobbin, GitHub, a browser, or any external gallery. The goal is style grammar and product-pattern transfer, not brand impersonation or exact screen cloning.

## When to use

Use this style when the requested artifact matches the product job, emotional temperature, and UI density of `airbnb-marketplace-warm-consumer`. If the task names this brand/style directly, use this extension. If the task only names a category, route here when the component set below matches the requested surface better than the other packs.

## Visual and interaction principles

- Start from the user job and select the closest local component capsule before choosing colors or decorative treatment.
- Preserve hierarchy first: primary object, secondary metadata, tertiary controls, then ambient decoration.
- Use the token system rather than ad-hoc colors. Color anchors: `canvas`=#ffffff; `surface`=#ffffff; `panel`=#f7f7f7; `text`=#222222; `muted`=#717171; `border`=#dddddd; `accent`=#ff385c; `accent2`=#00a699.
- Use the typography roles deliberately. Type anchors: `ui`=Inter/system sans-serif; `mono`=ui-monospace/SFMono-Regular.
- Respect the shape and density system: spacing scale present, radius scale present.
- Prefer restrained adaptation over literal copying. Do not reuse logos, exact text, private data, or proprietary screen layout one-to-one.

## Runtime component set

- `booking-card` — booking card
- `category-tabs` — category tabs
- `checkout-reservation-flow` — checkout reservation flow
- `filter-modal` — filter modal
- `host-profile-card` — host profile card
- `listing-card` — listing card
- `listing-detail-gallery` — listing detail gallery
- `map-results-layout` — map results layout
- `reviews-section` — reviews section
- `search-bar` — search bar

For each component, load the capsule in `components/capsules/<component-id>.md` first. Then use `components/extracted/` and `evidence/source-map/` only when you need provenance or visual facts. Use `pack/components/airbnb-marketplace-warm-consumer/` for short semantic slices when a retrieval system asks for compact component context.

## Evidence coverage

- Mobbin screens: 20
- Mobbin sections: 20
- Mobbin flow previews: 25
- Public web pages captured: 1
- Authenticated screenshots: 1

These are build-time artifacts already stored locally. Runtime agents must not fetch more evidence unless explicitly asked to run a new extraction wave.

## Agent recipe

1. Read `pack/styles/airbnb-marketplace-warm-consumer/DESIGN.md` for the unified baseline + extension view.
2. Load `pack/extensions/airbnb-marketplace-warm-consumer/tokens/tokens.json` and `tokens/css-vars.css` for implementation values.
3. Pick 1-3 capsules from `pack/extensions/airbnb-marketplace-warm-consumer/components/capsules/` that match the requested screen.
4. Compose with the local style formula and component grammar.
5. Run the result against `pack/extensions/airbnb-marketplace-warm-consumer/eval/checklist.yaml` and `eval/failure-modes.md`.
6. If the output feels generic, increase fidelity through component structure and hierarchy, not by copying exact source screens.

## Do

- Use local tokens and capsules as the first source of truth.
- Make state, status, and user action obvious.
- Keep density and spacing consistent across related surfaces.
- Use evidence-backed component vocabulary when describing or implementing the UI.

## Do not

- Do not call web search, GitHub, Mobbin, browser/CDP, or external services at runtime for style guidance.
- Do not clone exact production screens, logos, copy, private account data, or proprietary code.
- Do not mix this style with another pack unless the user explicitly asks for a hybrid.
- Do not substitute a moodboard description for component-level structure.


## Component atlas excerpt

# Component atlas

Runtime component atlas for `airbnb-marketplace-warm-consumer`.

Use this file to choose the right capsule before implementation. The capsule is the detailed recipe; this atlas is the router.

## `booking-card` — Airbnb Marketplace Warm Consumer — Booking Card

Use when: the artifact needs `booking card` behavior, layout, or decision structure.
Capsule: `components/capsules/booking-card.md`
Semantic slice: `pack/components/airbnb-marketplace-warm-consumer/booking-card.md`
Evidence links recorded: `2` index path groups; see local source map and extracted folders for detail.

Design job:
- Preserve this style formula: warm consumer marketplace; photo-first listing cards; search/filter/map rhythm; hospitality trust, reviews and booking clarity; soft neutral canvas with confident coral action
- Keep the component's primary object obvious before adding decoration.
- Use token roles and density from `tokens/tokens.json` instead of inventing ad-hoc values.
- Adapt the grammar to the new product context; do not clone exact evidence screens.

Implementation notes:
- Start with semantic structure and states.
- Add controls, status, metadata, and supporting copy in that order.
- Check responsive behavior and empty/error/loading states when relevant.

## Agent contract excerpt

# Agent contract — Airbnb Marketplace Warm Consumer

This contract tells an agent how to use `airbnb-marketplace-warm-consumer` inside the unified Hermes design pack.

## Required load order

1. `pack/styles/airbnb-marketplace-warm-consumer/DESIGN.md` — unified style entry and broad baseline context.
2. `pack/extensions/airbnb-marketplace-warm-consumer/STYLE.md` — concise runtime formula and operating rules.
3. `pack/extensions/airbnb-marketplace-warm-consumer/tokens/tokens.json` plus `tokens/css-vars.css` — implementation anchors.
4. `pack/extensions/airbnb-marketplace-warm-consumer/components/component-atlas.md` — choose the closest reusable surface.
5. `pack/extensions/airbnb-marketplace-warm-consumer/components/capsules/<component-id>.md` — detailed component grammar.
6. `pack/components/airbnb-marketplace-warm-consumer/<component-id>.md` — compact semantic retrieval slice.
7. `pack/extensions/airbnb-marketplace-warm-consumer/eval/checklist.yaml`, `eval/rubric.md`, and `eval/failure-modes.md` — quality gate.

## Authority rule

The deep Hermes extension overrides the broad VoltAgent baseline whenever they differ. The baseline provides vocabulary; this extension provides implementation constraints, local evidence, component structure, and failure modes.

## Runtime boundary

Use local files only. GitHub, Mobbin, Firecrawl, Browser/CDP, Playwright, and authenticated sessions are build-time enrichment lanes. Runtime style use should remain offline, deterministic, and repo-first.

## Generation protocol

- Identify the product job and information hierarchy before styling.
- Select the nearest component capsule by semantic job, not by visual decoration.
- Apply tokens exactly where possible; when adapting, keep role semantics stable.
- Preserve accessibility basics: readable contrast, usable target sizes, clear focus/selected/error states.
- State uncertainty if the requested surface has no matching capsule, then compose from the closest primitives.

## Review protocol

A result is acceptable only if it passes the local eval layer and can name which capsules/tokens shaped it. If it cannot cite local pack paths, it did not really use the style system.

## Safety

Adapt style grammar. Do not impersonate the brand, reuse logos, reproduce exact screens, copy private data, or import proprietary source code.
