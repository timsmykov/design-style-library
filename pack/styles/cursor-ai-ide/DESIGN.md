# Unified DESIGN.md — Cursor AI IDE

This file is the single-pack runtime view for `cursor-ai-ide`.

Authority inside this file:

1. VoltAgent DESIGN.md baseline gives broad visual grammar.
2. Hermes deep extension overrides baseline with local evidence, tokens, components, eval, and implementation guardrails.
3. Use local paths only; do not call GitHub/Mobbin/web/browser at runtime.

description: An AI-first code editor whose marketing site reads like a quietly-confident developer-tools brand with a warm-cream editorial canvas (`#f7f7f4`) instead of the typical dark IDE atmosphere. Near-black warm ink (`#26251e`) carries body and display alike — display sits at weight 400 with negative letter-spacing for a magazine feel rather than a bold tech voice. The single brand voltage is **Cursor Orange** (`#f54e00`) reserved for primary CTAs and the wordmark. A signature pastel timeline palette (peach, mint, blue, lavender, gold) marks AI-action stages (Thinking / Reading / Editing / Grepping / Done) — only inside in-product timeline visualizations. Cards use minimal hairlines, no shadows, generous 80px section rhythm. CursorGothic for display/body, JetBrains Mono on every code surface (which is roughly half the page).

# Hermes deep extension override

## STYLE.md excerpt

# Cursor AI IDE

Status: runtime-ready extension inside the unified Hermes design pack.

## Style formula

AI code editor workspace; dark IDE shell; chat/composer sidecar; files, diffs, terminal and model controls as first-class surfaces; practical developer speed over decoration

This pack is meant for generation, review, and critique. It should give an agent enough local information to design a screen without opening Mobbin, GitHub, a browser, or any external gallery. The goal is style grammar and product-pattern transfer, not brand impersonation or exact screen cloning.

## When to use

Use this style when the requested artifact matches the product job, emotional temperature, and UI density of `cursor-ai-ide`. If the task names this brand/style directly, use this extension. If the task only names a category, route here when the component set below matches the requested surface better than the other packs.

## Visual and interaction principles

- Start from the user job and select the closest local component capsule before choosing colors or decorative treatment.
- Preserve hierarchy first: primary object, secondary metadata, tertiary controls, then ambient decoration.
- Use the token system rather than ad-hoc colors. Color anchors: `canvas`=#0b0d12; `surface`=#11141b; `panel`=#171b24; `text`=#f4f7fb; `muted`=#9aa4b2; `border`=#2a3140; `accent`=#7c3aed; `accent2`=#38bdf8.
- Use the typography roles deliberately. Type anchors: `ui`=Inter/system sans-serif; `mono`=ui-monospace/SFMono-Regular.
- Respect the shape and density system: spacing scale present, radius scale present.
- Prefer restrained adaptation over literal copying. Do not reuse logos, exact text, private data, or proprietary screen layout one-to-one.

## Runtime component set

- `ai-chat-panel` — ai chat panel
- `composer-command-card` — composer command card
- `diff-review-pane` — diff review pane
- `editor-shell` — editor shell
- `file-explorer` — file explorer
- `model-selector` — model selector
- `onboarding-import-project` — onboarding import project
- `pricing-plan-grid` — pricing plan grid
- `settings-preferences` — settings preferences
- `terminal-panel` — terminal panel

For each component, load the capsule in `components/capsules/<component-id>.md` first. Then use `components/extracted/` and `evidence/source-map/` only when you need provenance or visual facts. Use `pack/components/cursor-ai-ide/` for short semantic slices when a retrieval system asks for compact component context.

## Evidence coverage

- Mobbin screens: 20
- Mobbin sections: 20
- Mobbin flow previews: 20
- Public web pages captured: 2
- Authenticated screenshots: 1

These are build-time artifacts already stored locally. Runtime agents must not fetch more evidence unless explicitly asked to run a new extraction wave.

## Agent recipe

1. Read `pack/styles/cursor-ai-ide/DESIGN.md` for the unified baseline + extension view.
2. Load `pack/extensions/cursor-ai-ide/tokens/tokens.json` and `tokens/css-vars.css` for implementation values.
3. Pick 1-3 capsules from `pack/extensions/cursor-ai-ide/components/capsules/` that match the requested screen.
4. Compose with the local style formula and component grammar.
5. Run the result against `pack/extensions/cursor-ai-ide/eval/checklist.yaml` and `eval/failure-modes.md`.
6. If the output feels generic, increase fidelity through component structure and hierarchy, not by copying exact source screens.

## Do

- Use local tokens and capsules as the first source of truth.
- Make state, status, and user action obvious.
- Keep density and spacing consistent across related surfaces.
- Use evidence-backed component vocabulary when describing or implementing the UI.

## Do not

- Do not call web search, GitHub, Mobbin, browser/CDP, or external services at runtime for style guidance.
- Do not clone exact production screens, logos, copy, private account data, or proprietary code.
- Do not mix this style with another pack unless the user explicitly asks for a hybrid.
- Do not substitute a moodboard description for component-level structure.


## Component atlas excerpt

# Component atlas

Runtime component atlas for `cursor-ai-ide`.

Use this file to choose the right capsule before implementation. The capsule is the detailed recipe; this atlas is the router.

## `ai-chat-panel` — Cursor AI IDE — Ai Chat Panel

Use when: the artifact needs `ai chat panel` behavior, layout, or decision structure.
Capsule: `components/capsules/ai-chat-panel.md`
Semantic slice: `pack/components/cursor-ai-ide/ai-chat-panel.md`
Evidence links recorded: `2` index path groups; see local source map and extracted folders for detail.

Design job:
- Preserve this style formula: AI code editor workspace; dark IDE shell; chat/composer sidecar; files, diffs, terminal and model controls as first-class surfaces; practical developer speed over decoration
- Keep the component's primary object obvious before adding decoration.
- Use token roles and density from `tokens/tokens.json` instead of inventing ad-hoc values.
- Adapt the grammar to the new product context; do not clone exact evidence screens.

Implementation notes:
- Start with semantic structure and states.
- Add controls, status, metadata, and supporting copy in that order.
- Check responsive behavior and empty/error/loading states when relevant.

## Agent contract excerpt

# Agent contract — Cursor AI IDE

This contract tells an agent how to use `cursor-ai-ide` inside the unified Hermes design pack.

## Required load order

1. `pack/styles/cursor-ai-ide/DESIGN.md` — unified style entry and broad baseline context.
2. `pack/extensions/cursor-ai-ide/STYLE.md` — concise runtime formula and operating rules.
3. `pack/extensions/cursor-ai-ide/tokens/tokens.json` plus `tokens/css-vars.css` — implementation anchors.
4. `pack/extensions/cursor-ai-ide/components/component-atlas.md` — choose the closest reusable surface.
5. `pack/extensions/cursor-ai-ide/components/capsules/<component-id>.md` — detailed component grammar.
6. `pack/components/cursor-ai-ide/<component-id>.md` — compact semantic retrieval slice.
7. `pack/extensions/cursor-ai-ide/eval/checklist.yaml`, `eval/rubric.md`, and `eval/failure-modes.md` — quality gate.

## Authority rule

The deep Hermes extension overrides the broad VoltAgent baseline whenever they differ. The baseline provides vocabulary; this extension provides implementation constraints, local evidence, component structure, and failure modes.

## Runtime boundary

Use local files only. GitHub, Mobbin, Firecrawl, Browser/CDP, Playwright, and authenticated sessions are build-time enrichment lanes. Runtime style use should remain offline, deterministic, and repo-first.

## Generation protocol

- Identify the product job and information hierarchy before styling.
- Select the nearest component capsule by semantic job, not by visual decoration.
- Apply tokens exactly where possible; when adapting, keep role semantics stable.
- Preserve accessibility basics: readable contrast, usable target sizes, clear focus/selected/error states.
- State uncertainty if the requested surface has no matching capsule, then compose from the closest primitives.

## Review protocol

A result is acceptable only if it passes the local eval layer and can name which capsules/tokens shaped it. If it cannot cite local pack paths, it did not really use the style system.

## Safety

Adapt style grammar. Do not impersonate the brand, reuse logos, reproduce exact screens, copy private data, or import proprietary source code.
